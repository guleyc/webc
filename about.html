<h2>About</h2>

<p>
    My name is Jay and I have been developing web solutions and optimizing online presence for businesses for over 15
    years.
    With expertise in PHP, Python, and modern web technologies, Iâ€™ve helped dozens of businesses transform their digital
    presence through custom development, server optimization, and comprehensive SEO strategies. My approach combines
    technical excellence with business-focused solutions that deliver measurable results.
    I founded WEBC with a simple mission: to provide clients with web solutions that not only look great but also
    perform exceptionally well in terms of speed, security, and search visibility. Every project we undertake is driven
    by this commitment to excellence and business impact.
